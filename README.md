# OLIVE dataset

OLIVE (Open-world Language Instruction for Visual-language Evaluation) is a highly diverse, human-corrected multimodal dataset designed to simulate the variety and idiosyncrasies of user queries vision-language models (VLMs) encounter in real-world scenarios, facilitating the training and evaluation of these models under conditions that more closely resemble their ultimate use cases.

OLIVE contains 9,450 images, 30,120 unique instructions, and 47,250 responses. The images are randomly sampled from [LAION-Aesthetics](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-aesthetics/). The instructions and responses are generated using ChatGPT and subsequently refined through human curation. Each image corresponds with five instruction-response pairs, with each pair featuring a unique response, although instructions may be reused across different pairs. The instruction-response pairs can be broadly categorized into four groups: visual recognition, creative writing, knowledge-based, and elaborated description. Below are some examples.
